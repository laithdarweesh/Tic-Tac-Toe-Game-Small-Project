# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (C# Windows Form)

Built a classic Tic Tac Toe desktop application with an interactive Windows Forms GUI. The game allows two players to take turns, tracks moves, detects wins or draws, and provides a restart functionality.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Classes, Enums, and Structs to manage game state and player turns.

Applied Event-Driven Programming for handling button clicks and game interactions.

Designed GUI with Windows Forms, including drawing the board using Graphics and dynamically updating button images (X/O).

Developed game logic to check rows, columns, diagonals for a winner and handle game progression.

Modular methods (ChangeImage(), CheckWinner(), EndGame(), RestartGame()) for clean and maintainable code.

ðŸš€ This project demonstrates skills in desktop application development, game logic design, event handling, and GUI programming with C#.
